# Real Estate Scanner - Data Standards

**CRITICAL: No hallucinations or guesses!**

All data presented to Mr. Kelly must be:
- ✅ Verified from real sources
- ✅ Clearly marked if estimated/calculated
- ❌ NEVER made up or assumed

## What Data Is Real

| Source | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Property addresses from Zillow/GitHub | ✅ Real |
| Calculations (mortgage, CF, CoC) | ✅ Calculated |
| Market rent estimates | ⚠️ Marked as "estimated" |
| Condition scores | ❌ NOT verified - placeholder only |

---

## Current Data Status

**Properties in analysis:**
- Addresses - Real (from previous session)
- Prices - Need verification
- Beds/Baths/SqFt - Need verification  
- Condition scores - PLACEHOLDER ONLY ❌

**Calculations:**
- Cash flow (mortgage + 50% rule) - Accurate
- CoC returns - Accurate
- All formulas - Verified

## What Needs Real Data

To make this useful, we need Mr. Kelly to provide:
1. Actual property listings (paste links or addresses)
2. Verified condition from photos/virtual tours
3. Actual rent comparables from market research

## Until Then

❌ Don't present "top deals" or rankings  
❌ Don't show condition-based rehab costs  
⚠️ Only show calculations on verified data  

✅ Show formulas/methodology  
✅ Show calculations on user-provided numbers  
✅ Ask for real data before analyzing
