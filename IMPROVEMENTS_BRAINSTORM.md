# Project Improvements & New Ideas
*Brainstorming - February 27, 2026*

---

## 1. REAL ESTATE - Improvements

### Current State
- Manual property analysis from HAR.com/Zillow links
- 3 passing duplexes, SFRs failing at current prices
- Simple 50% rule, fixed $100K down payment assumption

### Ideas to Improve

#### A. Data Sources (Scrape More)
- **County Tax Auctions** - Tarrant County has monthly auctions, often 30-50% below market
- **HUD Homes** - hudhomestore.gov - federally owned REOs
- **FSBO Listings** - Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace
- **Wholesale Clubs** - Connect with property wholesalers who sell contracts

#### B. Analysis Enhancements
- **BRRRR Strategy** - Add "Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat" analysis
- **House Hacking** - Model living in one unit of duplex vs full rental
- **Seller Financing** - Factor in seller-financed deals (often 0% interest)
- **Section 8 Vouchers** - Higher guaranteed rent, longer leases
- **Rent-to-Own** - Premium pricing but stable tenants

#### C. Deal-Finding Automation
- Set up alerts for new listings <$180K in target zips
- Monitor price reductions (we saw Kings Trl had -$21K drop)
- Track days on market - properties 60+ days = negotiating power

#### D. New Target Strategy
- **Focus on duplexes** - 3/3 passing is clear signal
- **Look for "sold as-is"** - 3817 Longmeadow barely passed because of discount potential
- **Partner with wholesalers** - They find deals, you fund/manage

## 2. BUSINESS IDEAS - Improvements

### Current Rankings
1. Mobile Car Detailing ($3,300-6,500)
2. Pressure Washing ($3,900-11,800)
3. Ceramic Coating ($4,000-9,000)

### Ideas to Improve

#### A. Mobile Detailing - Add-ons
- **Interior Deep Clean** - $200+ premium service
- **Ceramic Coating Upsell** - 50% margin on product, charge $800
- **Fleet Contracts** - Local body shops, rental car companies, dealership prep
- **Subscription Model** - $99/mo = 1 detail/month = predictable revenue

#### B. Pressure Washing - Expand
- **Gutter Cleaning** - $100-200 per job, bundles well
- **Soft Wash Roofs** - $300-500, less wear on equipment
- **Commercial** - Shopping centers, apartment complexes = recurring

#### C. New Business Idea: Junk Removal
- **Startup:** $1,500-3,000 (truck, dumpster, gloves)
- **Why:** Low competition, high demand, labor-intensive but simple
- **Pricing:** $150-400 per load, 2-3 jobs/day = $300-1,200/day
- **Better than pressure washing?** Higher margins, less equipment wear

#### D. New Business Idea: Mobile RV/Boat Detail
- **Startup:** $2,000 extra (specialty chemicals, tools)
- **Why:** Fort Worth has lakes, high-income owners
- **Pricing:** $300-800 per RV, $150-300 per boat
- **Competition:** Very low, niche market

## 3. TEMPLATES / FIVERR - Improvements

### Current State
- Business plans, templates on GitHub
- Need to identify what's actually selling

### Ideas to Improve

#### A. New Template Products
- **Real Estate Investment Calculator** - Excel/Python tool
- **Property Analysis Spreadsheet** - The exact model we use
- **Airbnb Calculator** - Short-term rental math
- **House Hacking Calculator** - Duplex living + rental income

#### B. Fiverr Gigs to Test
1. "I will create a real estate investment analysis spreadsheet"
2. "I will research local real estate markets and find investment opportunities"
3. "I will build a business financial model in Excel"
4. "I will analyze a property deal and tell you if it's a good investment"

#### C. Pricing Strategy
- Start at $25-50 for basic templates
- Upsell to $150+ for custom analysis
- Bundle: Template + 30-min consultation call

## 4. SYSTEMS & AUTOMATION

### Ideas
- **Daily Property Alert** - Script runs each morning, texts new listings
- **Deal Grading** - Auto-score properties (price vs rent vs condition)
- **Comps Auto-Pull** - Use county appraisal data to auto-fetch recent sales
- **Offer Generator** - Based on ARV, repair costs, desired CoC

---

## PRIORITY ACTION ITEMS

1. **Set up Tarrant County tax auction monitoring** - Highest potential for 30-50% discounts
2. **Build property analysis tool as a template product** - Dual purpose (own use + sell)
3. **Test junk removal or RV detailing** - Lower startup than current top ideas
4. **Create subscription model for detailing** - Predictable revenue
