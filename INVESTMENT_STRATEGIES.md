## Part 1: Key Metrics & Calculations

### 1. Cash-on-Cash Return (CoC)

**Definition:** Annual pre-tax cash flow divided by total cash invested.

```
CoC = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Purchase Price: $200,000
- Down Payment: $50,000
- Closing Costs: $5,000
- Rehab: $10,000
- Total Cash Invested: $65,000
- Monthly Cash Flow: $400
- Annual Cash Flow: $4,800

```
CoC = ($4,800 / $65,000) × 100 = 7.4%
```

**Target:** 8-12% for good deals

---

### 2. Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)

**Definition:** Net Operating Income (NOI) divided by property value.

```
Cap Rate = (NOI / Property Value) × 100
```

Where NOI = Gross Rent - Operating Expenses (excluding mortgage)

**Example:**
- Property: $250,000
- Gross Rent: $2,400/mo = $28,800/yr
- Operating Expenses (50%): $14,400/yr
- NOI: $14,400/yr

```
Cap Rate = ($14,400 / $250,000) × 100 = 5.76%
```

**Target:** 5-10% depending on market

---

### 3. Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)

**Definition:** Property price divided by gross annual rent.

```
GRM = Property Price / Annual Gross Rent
```

**Example:**
- Property: $200,000
- Monthly Rent: $1,800
- Annual Rent: $21,600

```
GRM = $200,000 / $21,600 = 9.26
```

**Interpretation:** Lower GRM = better deal (typically 5-10 is acceptable)

---

### 4. 1% Rule

**Rule of Thumb:** Monthly rent should be at least 1% of purchase price.

**Example:**
- Purchase Price: $200,000
- 1% Rule: $2,000/mo minimum rent

**Reality Check:** Only works in certain markets; use as quick filter

---

### 5. 50% Rule

**Rule of Thumb:** Assume 50% of rent goes to expenses.

**Example:**
- Monthly Rent: $2,000
- Expenses (50%): $1,000
- Available for Mortgage: $1,000

**Components Included in 50%:**
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Vacancy (5-10%)
- Repairs (5-10%)
- Property management (10%)
- HOA
- Utilities (if paid)

---

### 6. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

**Definition:** NOI divided by annual debt service.

```
DSCR = NOI / Annual Debt Service
```

**Example:**
- NOI: $14,400/yr
- Annual Mortgage (P&I): $9,600

```
DSCR = $14,400 / $9,600 = 1.5
```

**Target:** 1.25+ (lenders prefer 1.25-1.5)

---

### 7. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Definition:** Total return including equity buildup + cash flow + appreciation.

```
IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0
```

**Simplified Version (5-Year Hold):**
```
Total Return = (Equity Buildup + Appreciation + Cash Flow) / Investment
```

---

## Part 2: Investment Strategies

### 1. BRRRR Method

**Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat**

| Step | Action | Goal |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Buy distressed property | Below market |
| 2 | Renovate | Add value |
| 3 | Rent | Generate income |
| 4 | Refinance | Pull out cash |
| 5 | Repeat | Scale portfolio |

**BRRRR Calculator:**
```
After Repair Value (ARV): $250,000
Purchase + Rehab: $200,000
Refinance (75% of ARV): $187,500
Cash Out: $187,500 - $150,000 = $37,500
```

---

### 2. House Hacking

**Live in one unit, rent others**

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Multi-family Live-in | Buy 2-4 unit, live in one |
| ADU | Accessory Dwelling Unit |
| Room Rental | Rent rooms in SFR |

**Example - Duplex:**
- Live in Unit A (3BR/2BA)
- Rent Unit B (2BR/2BA) = $1,200/mo
- Your "rent" = $0 (plus build equity)

---

### 3. Seller Financing

**Seller carries note instead of bank**

**Benefits:**
- No bank qualifying
- Flexible terms
- Lower closing costs
- Potentially lower interest

**Structure:**
```
Purchase Price: $200,000
Down Payment: $20,000 (10%)
Interest Rate: 6%
Term: 30 years
Monthly Payment: $1,079
```

---

### 4. Lease Option (Rent-to-Own)

**Rent with option to buy**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Option Fee | $2,000-$5,000 (non-refundable) |
| Monthly Rent | Market rate + $200 premium |
| Purchase Price | Fixed at lease signing |
| Lease Term | 1-3 years |

**Strategy:** Lock in future price, tenant builds equity

---

### 5. Subject To Financing

**Take over seller's mortgage**

- Assume existing loan (no new financing)
- Seller remains liable (or not)
- Fast closing
- Lower costs

**Warning:** Due on sale clause may trigger

---

### 6. Wholesaling

**Find deals, assign contract**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Find distressed property |
| 2 | Under contract at discount |
| 3 | Assign to end buyer |
| 4 | Collect assignment fee |

**Earnings:** $2,000-$10,000 per deal

---

### 7. Fix and Flip

**Buy, renovate, sell quickly**

**Formula:**
```
Profit = Sale Price - (Purchase + Rehab + Holding Costs + Closing Costs)
```

**Target Profit:** 20-30% after all costs

| Cost Category | Typical % |
|--------------|-----------|
| Purchase | 70-80% |
| Rehab | 10-20% |
| Holding | 5% |
| Closing | 6-10% |
| Profit | 10-30% |

---

### 8. Commercial / DSCR Loans

**For rental properties (1-4 units)**

| Factor | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Credit Score | 620+ |
| DSCR | 1.0+ |
| LTV | Up to 80% |
| Reserves | 6 months |

**DSCR Calculation:**
```
NOI / Mortgage Payment = DSCR
$1,500 / $1,200 = 1.25 ✅
```

---

## Part 3: Advanced Calculations

### 1. Amortization Schedule

**Monthly Payment Formula:**
```
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Principal loan amount
r = Monthly interest rate
n = Number of payments
```

**Example:** $150,000 loan, 6.5%, 30 years
```
Monthly Payment = $948
```

---

### 2. Loan Paydown Schedule (Year 1)

| Month | Payment | Principal | Interest | Balance |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | $948 | $135 | $813 | $149,865 |
| 6 | $948 | $142 | $806 | $149,150 |
| 12 | $948 | $150 | $798 | $148,200 |

**Year 1 Equity Build:** ~$1,800

---

### 3. Appreciation Projection

**3% Annual Appreciation:**
```
Year 1: $200,000 → $206,000
Year 3: $200,000 → $218,545
Year 5: $200,000 → $231,854
Year 10: $200,000 → $268,783
```

---

### 4. Rent Increase Scenario

**With 3% annual rent increase:**

| Year | Rent | Cash Flow | Cumulative |
|------|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | $1,800 | $4,800 | $4,800 |
| 2 | $1,854 | $5,208 | $10,008 |
| 3 | $1,910 | $5,644 | $15,652 |
| 5 | $2,024 | $6,588 | $27,892 |

---

### 5. Total Return Calculation

**5-Year Hold Example:**

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Cash Flow (5yr) | $28,000 |
| Equity Buildup | $15,000 |
| Appreciation (3%/yr) | $31,854 |
| **Total Return** | **$74,854** |
| **IRR** | **23%/yr** |

### 1. Reserve Fund Calculator

| Expense Type | Recommended Reserve |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Vacancy | 2-3 months rent |
| Repairs | 1-2 months rent |
| CapEx | 1 month rent |
