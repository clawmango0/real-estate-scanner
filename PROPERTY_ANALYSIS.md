## Summary

| Property | Price | Rent (Real) | Cash Flow | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 2713 Cordone St | $200,000 | $1,409/mo | -$265/mo | ❌ |
| 3213 Leith Ave | $265,600 | $1,409/mo | -$732/mo | ❌ |
| 216 Rodeo Dr | $255,000 | $1,822/mo | -$470/mo | ❌ |

## Key Insight

Even with real market rent data, these SFR prices are too high for cash flow. The math:

- Need rent-to-price ratio of ~0.8-1% for positive cash flow
- These areas: 0.65-0.72% rent/price ratio
- **Would need 30-40% price reduction to work**

## What Works

The duplexes that passed before (from earlier analysis):
- 7652 Colorado Creek: $212K @ $2,602 rent = +$343/mo ✅
- 8812 Texas Risinger: $203K @ $2,400 rent = +$309/mo ✅

Multi-unit properties work because rent > mortgage + expenses.
