## Key Insights

1. **Multi-unit is key** - Duplexes and properties with rental potential (shops, ADUs) cash flow positive
2. **Longer on market = better deal** - Properties 60+ days get 15% discount = much better returns
3. **Already leased properties** - Best source of instant cash flow (8812 Texas Risinger)
4. **SFRs mostly don't work** - At these price points, need $100K+ down to break even
