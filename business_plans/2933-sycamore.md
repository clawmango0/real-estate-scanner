3. **Large Loan** - $350K+ loan = higher risk
4. **Limited Data** - Not much listing info available

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED AT $449,900** - Violates all investment criteria.

**Only consider if:**
- Negotiate to $260K-$300K range
- Or partner with another investor
- Or use BRRRR strategy

**Better alternatives available:**
1. 7652 Colorado Creek - 12.3% CoC
2. 8812 Texas Risinger - 12.8% CoC
3. 4516 Rutland - 8.4% CoC

---

## Alternative: BRRRR Strategy

If acquired at $300K:

| Phase | Action | Expected |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Buy | Purchase at $300K | $300K |
| Renovate | Add value | +$20K |
| Rent | Generate income | $3,200/mo |
| Refinance | Pull cash out | ~$280K (75% ARV) |
| Cash Out | Profit | ~$0 + equity |

**Risk:** High loan amount, limited cash flow

---

## Timeline (If Proceeding)

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Get property details, schedule showing |
| 2 | Make low offer ($260K) |
| 3 | Negotiate, agree on price |
| 4 | Inspection, due diligence |
| 5-6 | Close, renovate |
| 7-8 | Rent, refinance |

---

## Final Recommendation

| Status | Score |
|--------|-------|
| At Asking Price | ❌ DO NOT PROCEED |
| If Negotiated to $260K | ✅ CAN PROCEED |
| **OVERALL** | **❌ RECOMMEND TO PASS** |

**Recommend pursuing better options (Colorado Creek, Texas Risinger)**
