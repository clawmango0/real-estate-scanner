## ⚠️ RE-EVALUATE: Does NOT Cash Flow

**Note:** At full price ($449,900), this property does NOT meet our criteria. However, if you can negotiate significantly:

---

## If Negotiate to $350K

## Pros ✅ (If Price Reduced)

1. **Larger Property** - More sqft, more rent potential
2. **Below Market Price/Sqft** - Even at $350K = $130/sqft
3. **Multi-unit** - Two income streams
4. **Established Area** - Good rental demand

---

## Cons ❌

1. **Above Budget** - $450K is 80% over our $250K target
2. **Negative Cash Flow** - At asking price, loses money
3. **Large Loan** - $350K+ loan = higher risk
4. **Limited Data** - Not much listing info available
5. **May Need Rehab** - 1985 construction

## Tasks to Resolve ✅

| Task | Priority | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Verify listing details | HIGH | ⬜ | Get actual sqft, units |
| Negotiate price | CRITICAL | ⬜ | Need <$350K to work |
| Property inspection | HIGH | ⬜ | Confirm condition |
| Confirm rent potential | HIGH | ⬜ | $3,091 realistic? |
| Evaluate financing | MEDIUM | ⬜ | 15-year? PMI? |
| Compare to alternatives | MEDIUM | ⬜ | Better options at $250K? |

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT proceed at $449,900** - violates cash flow criteria.

**Only proceed if:**
- Negotiate to $340K or below
- Or partner with another investor
- Or use as BRRRR (buy, renovate, refinance)

---

## Alternative Strategy: BRRRR

| Phase | Action | Expected |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Buy | Purchase at discount | $350K |
| Renovate | Add value | +$30K |
| Rent | Generate income | $3,200/mo |
| Refinance | Pull cash out | ~$300K |
| Repeat | Next property | -- |
