## Analysis Notes

**This is a SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE** - not a multi-unit property.

With a 15% discount offer ($203,900), this property still fails most investment criteria:
- Negative cash flow: -$121/mo
- Low Cash-on-Cash: -2.8%
- Below DSCR threshold

### Why It Fails:
1. **SFR Economics** - Single family homes in this price range typically don't cash flow in Fort Worth area
2. **High Price/Sqft** - $171/sqft is reasonable but not a deal
3. **Only One Income Stream** - No diversification like duplex

### What Would Make It Work:
1. Finding a multi-unit (duplex/triplex) in this area
2. Much larger discount (25%+)
3. Adding a second unit or ADU
4. Owner-financing with low down payment

---

## Pros ✅

1. **Good Location** - Watauga, near Fort Worth
2. **Established Area** - 1982 build, neighborhood established
3. **No HOA** - No monthly fees

---

## Cons ❌

1. **Negative Cash Flow** - -$121/mo
2. **Fails 1% Rule** - Only 0.8%
3. **SFR** - Single income stream
4. **Unknown Condition** - Need inspection

---

## Recommendation

| Status | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Cash Flow | -$121/mo ❌ |
| Cash-on-Cash | -2.8% ❌ |
| DSCR | 0.93 ❌ |
| **OVERALL** | **❌ DO NOT PROCEED** |

**NOTES:**
- This is an SFR, not a multi-unit
- SFRs in this price range typically don't cash flow in this market
- Recommend focusing on duplexes like 7652 Colorado Creek Ct instead

## Comparison to Our Best Deal

| Property | Price | Rent | Cash Flow | CoC |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| 7652 Colorado Creek (DUPLEX) | $212,500 | $2,602 | +$1,025/mo | 12.3% ✅ |
| 6461 Westridge Dr (SFR) | $203,900 | $1,650 | -$121/mo | -2.8% ❌ |

**Key Insight:** Multi-unit properties are the way to go in this market!
