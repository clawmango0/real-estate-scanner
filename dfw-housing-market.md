## 📈 Market Outlook (from Nick Gerli / Reventure)
- **Demand Index**: 5/100 (near-record low, normal is 50)
- **Outlook**: Bearish - buyers are waiting, prices softening
- **2026 Forecast**: <1% price growth expected (Redfin)

---

## 🏠 What This Means for Our Strategy

1. **Prices still UP** in most ZIPs YoY despite low demand (2022-2024 boom)
2. **Days on market increasing** - 122 days in 76133 is high
3. **Foreclosures rising** - 13 in 76133 alone
4. **Interest rates** keeping buyers on sidelines

### Recommendations:
- **Wait for better deals** - soft demand = more negotiating power
- **Target distressed properties** - foreclosures = potential discounts
- **Cash flow still works** in SW Fort Worth (76133) at right price
- **Don't overpay** - market is softening, prices likely to dip more

## 🚨 Reventure App Access Issue

**Problem:** Reventure App requires login/subscription to view ZIP-level data. No public API available.
- Map interface loads but data is behind authentication
- Would need $25-39/month for full access
- Alternative: Use Nick Gerli's free newsletter for macro data (we already have the 5/100 demand index)
