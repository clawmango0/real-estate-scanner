## Strategy 2: Seller Financing

### How to Find Seller Financing
1. **Direct mail** - Send letters to underwater homeowners
2. **Drive for dollars** - Look for distressed properties
3. **Pre-foreclosure list** - County clerk records
4. **Probate properties** - County probate court

### Magic Words to Use
- "Will you carry financing?"
- "Owner financing available?"
- "Flexible payment terms?"
- "Can I assume your loan?"

### Sample Letter to Sellers
```
Dear Homeowner,

I'm a local investor interested in buying homes in your area. 
If you're considering selling or know someone who is, I'd love to 
discuss flexible options including seller financing.

No bank needed. Quick closing.
