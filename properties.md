## The Hard Truth About This Market

⚠️ **Reality Check:** At these price points ($175K-$300K) with these rents ($1,350-$2,200), the 50% expense rule leaves almost NO positive cash flow on single-family homes.

- **20% Down:** 0/25 properties cash flow positive
- **10% Down:** 0/25 properties cash flow positive  
- **Only the 4-unit duplex** (4521 Evans Ave) shows positive cash flow!

**This market is an APPRECIATION PLAY, not a cash flow play.**

## Key Insights

### Why No Cash Flow?
- Prices have risen faster than rents in this hot Texas market
- $200K homes renting for $1,600-$1,800 = ~0.8-0.9% rule
- 50% expenses + mortgage = negative leverage

### What Works:
- 🔶 **4521 Evans Ave (4-unit)** - ONLY positive CF
- Appreciation potential (Texas market historically strong)
- Tax benefits (depreciation, deductions)
- Forced appreciation via upgrades

### Strategy Recommendations:
1. **Buy the 4-unit duplex** for actual cash flow
2. **Treat SFRs as appreciation plays** - don't expect monthly income
3. **Look for distressed properties** to force appreciation
4. **Consider house hacking** (live in one side of duplex)
