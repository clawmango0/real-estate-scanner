*Last Updated: February 25, 2026*

## PART 1: INITIAL CONTACT SCRIPTS

### 1.1 Phone Script (Inbound)

> **When phone rings:**
> 
> "Thanks for calling [Your Name] Mobile Detailing, this is [Your Name]. How can I help you today?"

> **If they ask about services/pricing:**
> 
> "We offer three main packages: Our Express detail is $75 and takes about 45 minutes. Our Signature detail is $145 and includes a full interior deep clean plus exterior wash and wax - about 1.5 hours. And our Premium detail is $275 for the full works - paint correction, leather conditioning, the whole package. Which sounds like the best fit for you?"

> **If they ask about availability:**
> 
> "I have availability [this week/day]. Do you prefer morning or afternoon? And do you have a preference for location - can you have me come to your home or office?"

> **To close:**
> 
> "Perfect. I'll send you a confirmation text right now with my arrival time. See you then!"

### 1.2 Outbound Call Script (Follow-up on leads)

> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Your Company]. I saw you requested a quote for detailing - did you still want to get that scheduled?
> 
> Great! I have availability [this day/time]. Would that work for you?
> 
> Perfect. I'll text you the booking confirmation. Looking forward to working with you!"

### 1.3 Text Message Templates

**Appointment Confirmation:**
> "Hi [Name]! This is [Your Name] confirming your detail appointment for [Day] at [Time]. I'll arrive at [Address]. Please have the car unlocked. See you then! Reply YES to confirm."

**Day-Before Reminder:**
> "Hi [Name]! Just a reminder - I'll be by tomorrow at [Time] for your detail. Please have the car unlocked and anything valuable removed. See you soon!"

**Post-Service Follow-Up:**
> "Hi [Name]! Just finished up - hope you love how your [car make/model] looks! If you have a minute, I'd really appreciate a review on Google. It helps other local car owners find us. Thanks!"

## PART 2: OBJECTION HANDLING

### 2.1 "That's too expensive"

**Response:**
> "I understand - price is important. Let me ask: what kind of results are you looking for? [Listen]
> 
> Here's what I'd say: We use premium products and take our time to do it right. A cheap detail might save $30 now but can actually damage your paint or leave streaks. We've had customers come to us after bad detail jobs that cost more to fix than what they saved. Would you rather get it done right the first time?"

**Alternative (offer alternatives):**
> "If the Signature detail is outside your budget, our Express at $75 is a great option for maintenance between deeper cleans. It won't be as thorough but it'll keep your car looking good."

### 2.2 "I can do it myself"

**Response:**
> "Absolutely - some people love detailing their own cars. [Pause]
> 
> Here's what I'd say: I used to detail my own cars too. The thing is, it takes the right products, proper technique, and about 3-4 hours. Most people don't have that time. And honestly, the results I get with my professional equipment and products are hard to match at home.
> 
> But hey, if you enjoy it, that's great! If you ever want a professional job without the hassle, I'm here."

### 2.3 "Let me think about it"

**Response:**
> "Of course, totally understand. [Pause]
> 
> Quick question - what specifically are you thinking about? Is it the price, the timing, or something else? [Listen and address specifically]
> 
> No problem. Here's my card - whenever you're ready, just text or call. I can usually get you in within a day or two."

### 2.4 "What's included?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. Our Signature detail includes: [read from service menu]
> 
> Is there anything specific you'd like focused on? Some customers want extra attention on the interior, others care most about the exterior shine."

### 2.5 "I'm not ready right now"

**Response:**
> "No problem at all. Can I ask - when would be a better time? [If they give date, put in calendar]
> 
> Perfect, I'll reach out [that week/day]. In the meantime, if you have any questions, just text me."
