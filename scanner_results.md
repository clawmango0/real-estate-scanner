## Investment Criteria
- Down Payment: $100K
- Target: +$200/mo CF, 8%+ CoC
- Price: $100K-$250K

## Why Properties Fail

| Property | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| SFRs ($215K-$250K) | Price too high for rent. Need <$150K |
| Duplexes ($285K) | Rent doesn't support price. Need <$210K |

## What Works

| Strategy | Target Price | Expected CF |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| SFR (all-cash) | <$150K | +$200+/mo |
| Duplex ($100K down) | <$210K | +$200+/mo |

## Recommendations

1. **Find distressed properties** <$150K (foreclosure, probate, tax lien)
2. **Seller financing** - negotiate below-market terms
3. **Rural areas** - Granbury, Godley, Rio Vista (cheaper)
4. **Lease option** - minimal cash upfront
5. **BRRRR** - refinance after rehab

## Action Items
- [ ] Set up alerts for properties <$150K
- [ ] Check county tax auctions
- [ ] Drive for dollars in target areas
- [ ] Network with wholesalers
